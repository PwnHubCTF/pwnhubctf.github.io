# What's PwnHUB ?

PwnHUB is a CTF Platform, containing all basic CTF features like **[CTFd](https://ctfd.io/)**, with a lot of additions.

<!-- You can **Try PwnHUB** with this demo **[pwnhub](https://pwnhub.io/)**. -->

### Main Features

In addition of basics ctf features, this framework has:
- An automatic challenge deploying system, to allow each user to have they own instance of challenges
- An XSS Bot integrated to the platform, for XSS web challenges
- A player category gestion, with their own associated scoreboards
- Auto-challenge importation: Push the challenges on a github repository, and they will be parsed & added to the ctf
- Signed flag for each player (automatically integrated for instance challenges), to avoid flag sharing

And many other cool stuff, like a theme gestion, UI Display choices for the player, a discord webhook to send the first bloods

Also, scoreboard is compatible with CTF Time:
scoreboard route: `/api/scoreboard`
